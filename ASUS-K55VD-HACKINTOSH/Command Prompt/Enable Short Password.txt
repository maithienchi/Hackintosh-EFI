pwpolicy -clearaccountpolicies

or
pwpolicy getaccountpolicies > ~/Desktop/file.plist
nano ~/Desktop/file.plist
Delete the first line, which says Getting global account policies to make the file valid XML.
Change the bolded part to your Regex.
policyAttributePassword matches '`**`^$|.{4,}+`**`'
pwpolicy setaccountpolicies ~/Desktop/file.plist
passwd
Presets:

^$|.{1,}+ : Any password. (Not the best Regex, but I didn't want to mess around with it too much.)

Change 4 to 1 and save
Confirmed this works with macOS Mojave (10.14).
